Step 1: Each party preprocesses their own data

Step 2: Parties upload the pre-processed data to their private files (Player-Data)

Step 3: LR Training (+ DP noise)

Step 4: Print the weights and bias (after the noise is applied) to both parties console

Step 4.5?: Python script takes console output and saves it in a file

Step 5: With the weights, each party can classify data IF they so choose (We are not sure which party will be classifying the data)
